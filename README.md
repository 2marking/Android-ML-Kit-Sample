# Android ML Kit Sample

This is a sample Android application I built in order to practice [Firebase's Machine learning kit](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml-kit/) (Firebase ML Kit).

## Related articles
After building this project, I wrote 2 articles about Firebase's ML Kit, [the first]() is more or an introduction to the topic, while [the second]() deals more specifically with using ML Kit's APIs in this application, and technologies/design patterns it uses in general.


## Libraries used in this project
This project uses dependencies from the new Android extension libraries (AndroidX). It also follows a MVVM architecture.
